HealthAI is an intelligent healthcare assistant application built using IBM WatsonX foundation models and deployed through a user-friendly Streamlit interface. The platform aims to provide users with instant, AI-powered support for health-related inquiries, basic disease prediction, treatment suggestions, and health data analytics.

This project integrates IBM Watson Machine Learning (WML) services with Granite foundation models (such as granite-13b-chat-v2) to generate natural, human-like responses to patient queries. It also supports storing patient data and chat history in a local SQLite database for continuity and basic record-keeping.

With a focus on accessibility and scalability, HealthAI empowers individuals to:

ðŸ“‹ Save and manage their personal health profiles

ðŸ’¬ Ask health-related questions and receive AI-generated responses

ðŸ§  Enter symptoms and receive basic disease predictions

ðŸ’Š Generate suggested treatment plans for known conditions

ðŸ“Š Visualize simple health metrics (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure trends)

By combining the power of generative AI with interactive web technologies and medical data organization, HealthAI serves as a stepping stone toward smarter, AI-driven digital health assistants for the future.
