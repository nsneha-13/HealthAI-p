HealthAI is an intelligent healthcare assistant application built using IBM WatsonX foundation models and deployed through a user-friendly Streamlit interface. The platform aims to provide users with instant, AI-powered support for health-related inquiries, basic disease prediction, treatment suggestions, and health data analytics.

This project integrates IBM Watson Machine Learning (WML) services with Granite foundation models (such as granite-13b-chat-v2) to generate natural, human-like responses to patient queries. It also supports storing patient data and chat history in a local SQLite database for continuity and basic record-keeping.

With a focus on accessibility and scalability, HealthAI empowers individuals to:

📋 Save and manage their personal health profiles

💬 Ask health-related questions and receive AI-generated responses

🧠 Enter symptoms and receive basic disease predictions

💊 Generate suggested treatment plans for known conditions

📊 Visualize simple health metrics (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure trends)

By combining the power of generative AI with interactive web technologies and medical data organization, HealthAI serves as a stepping stone toward smarter, AI-driven digital health assistants for the future.
